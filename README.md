===

Minimalistic Workflow Engine (mwe) in java.

Intent is to create a workflow engine, with limited functionality, that should suffice for many projects
that require simple to moderate workflow in their projects.

Goals of mwe:

1. The workflow engine should be easily embeddable in the parent application.
2. Very well defined set of insteructions on how to integrate into a java application.
3. Provide core workflow constructs which can solve simple to moderate workflow problems.
